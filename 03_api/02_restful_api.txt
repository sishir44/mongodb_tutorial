Introduction RESTful API:
* It is an architectural style for an application program interface(API) that uses HTTP requests to access and use data.
* REST is not a programming language.
* REST + API = RESTful API


How client and server works without APIs:
Client ---request-----> Server(database)
Client <---response----- Server(database)
* Client directly request to the server and server also directly response to the client.
* There is no any intermediate to connect b/w client and server.
* It is direct communication b/w Client and Server.

How client and server works with APIs:
Client ---(GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)----> RESTful API ------> Server(database)
Client <---(JSON / XML) ---- RESTful API <------ Server(database)  
* Client first request to API then request goes to server by diff methods as shown above.
* Server also send response to API and result send to Client on the JSON and XML formate.
* There is an intermediate to connect b/w client and server that is called API.

URL:
http://techyccr.com/api/users where users is an endpoint which is mandatory.

For CRUD operation we use diff HTTP methods:
CREATE ---> POST        eg: POST api/users
READ   ---> GET         eg: GET api/users
UPDATE ---> PUT, PATCH  eg: PUT/PATCH api/users
DELETE ---> DELETE      eg: DELETE api/users

* PUT allows us to update everything even though there is need small update.
* PATCH allows us to update only a particulr thing which we want to update.

NOTE:
* As per the REST (REpresentational “State” Transfer) architecture, the server does not store any state about the client session on the server-side. 
* Statelessness means that every HTTP request happens in complete isolation. 
* When the client makes an HTTP request, it includes all information necessary for the server to fulfill that request.
