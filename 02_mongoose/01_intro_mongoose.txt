Mongoose:
* It is also knows as MongoDBâ€™s framework. 
* It helps us to establish a connection between Nodejs and MongoDB. 
* Mongoose is an object data modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. 
* It manages relationship between data, provides schema validation, and is used to translate between object in code and 
    the representation of those object in MongooB. 


Diagram and connection:
Nodejs -----> mongoose ----->mongo driver ----> mongoDB----objectmapping--->Nodejs.
step:1        step:2          step:3            step:4                       step:1


MongoDB Connection:

const mongoose = require('mongoose');
// connection creation
mongoose.set('strictQuery', false);
mongoose.connect("mongodb://localhost:27017/shira or db_name", { useNewUrlParser: true }, { useUnifiedTopology: true })
.then( () => console.log("connection successfully...."))
.catch( (err) => console.log(err));

Steps:
I: run cmd -> npm init
II: install mongoose -> npm i mongoose
    make sure that the node version must be greater then 12, so only mongose will work fine.
III: finally to run the application we use following command
      - node src/app.js
