Logical Operator:

$and
Joins query clauses with a logical AND returns all documents that match the conditions of both clauses.

$not
Inverts the effect of a query expression and returns documents that do not match the query expression.

$nor
Joins query clauses with a logical NOR returns all documents that fail to match both clauses.

$or
Joins query clauses with a logical OR returns all documents that match the conditions of either clause.


Example:
Logical operator ($or)

const readDocument = async () => {
    try {
        const result = await Playlist
       .find({$or: [{ctype:"Back End"},{author:"Techy Sishir"}]}); // Logical operators      
        console.log(result);
    } 
    catch(err) {
        console.log(err);
    }
}
readDocument();
