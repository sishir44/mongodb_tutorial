Syntax for CURD Read Document:
    db.collection.findO(query,projection)
        where projection represets show(1) and hide(0)

* Find all result of the given collections.
    db.collection.find().pretty()

* Get only one document data as output whose name is rch.
    db.collection.find({name:'rch'}).pretty()

* Get only one document data as output with only name fields.
    db.collection.find({name:'rch'}, {name:1}).pretty()
        this will show only name fields = 1 -show
    db.collection.find({name:'rch'}, {name:0}).pretty()
        this will show except name fields = 0 - hide
    
* Get document data without _id field.
    db.collection.find({name:'rch'}, {_id:0, name:1}).pretty()

* For eg we have many documents with having 'active:true' fields but need to show first document only.
    db.collection.find({active:'true'}).pretty().limit(1)
        or
    db.collection.findOne({active:true})
